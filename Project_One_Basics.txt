PROJECT ONE

* Website for squash club members to enter internal league results, and knockout comp results
* Site should report current league positions and all results for that 6 week period
* Site should maintain results/final league tables history, searchable by user
* Should display knockout comp results, current round of comp, and comp history details 
* Potentially offer some stats analysis, ie. avg points conceded per game/match, etc (to be decided) 
* Internal leagues run in 6 weeks blocks, all year round
* Admin access should allow creation of new leagues with different participants every 6 weeks
* Admin access should allow creation of new knockout comp, allocation of dates to rounds (comps take a few months to complete)
* Both male and female sections
* Website should also display contacts details
* Each user should have their own username/password, plus ability to recover/reset password
* Should be simple to use, offer easily readable displays and be scalable for mobile use 
* This will actually be used by my squash club, so I guess I need to figure out what it will cost them to host somewhere ?
